INTRO                                                             *wstrip-intro*

This plugin uses `diff` to strip whitespace from lines that you changed while
editing.  This allows you to keep newly added lines clean without affecting
the history of existing lines.

==============================================================================
COMMAND                                                         *wstrip-command*

`:WStrip`                        Strips trailing whitespace on in the current
                               buffer lines.
==============================================================================
CONFIG                                                           *wstrip-config*

`g:wstrip_auto`                  Enables automatic cleaning of trailing
                               whitespace a buffer is saved.

                               Note: `b:wstrip_auto` can be used to enable
                               this option per-buffer.

                               Default: 0 (false)

`b:wstrip_trailing_max`          The maximum amount of trailing whitespace that
                               can exist before the remaining whitespace is
                               stripped.

                               Example: Set this value to `2` for the mail
                               |filetype| to handle `format=flowed` mail
                               composition.

                               Default: 0

`g:wstrip_highlight`             Enables highlighting of trailing whitespace
                               according to the `WStripTrailing` syntax group.

                               If enabled, only the excess whitespace (i.e.,
                               the trailing whitespace characters exceeding
                               `b:wstrip_trailing_max`) are highlighted.

                               Default: 1 (true)

`b:wstrip_highlight`             Per-buffer version of `g:wstrip_highlight`.

                               Default: 1 (true)
